# Sudoku solver
This is a project where I created a sudoku solver using nothing but my own knowledge (no docs, no StackOverflow, no example implementations etc.), because I had no internet access at the time of making this. It tries to deduct as much information as possible, and tries different moves when it gets stuck, kind of like a human.
